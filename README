# Bronto Playground
This is a repository for implementing Brontodroid and test it easily before 
we finalize things into a library/module to be consumed separately.

## Aim
The aim is to implement a Deno runtime on top of Android WebView, which
runs on WebKit, and inherently, JavaScriptCore for it's JS Execution. 
Which means we need to implement the Runtime from scratch. We aim to
implement the runtime in Kotlin as it allows for modern syntax and 
more efficiency and productivity with its features.

## Requirements
- IntelliJ IDEA (or Android Studio)
- Deno
- Kotlin
